## Abstract

The three-dimensional underwater movements of an object that vibrates with a fre- quency signature can be tracked using acoustic pressure measurements. Vibrations result in me- chanical disturbances that propagate through the fluid, increasing or decreasing pressure with time. Acoustic pressure data can be noisy. Using a noisy dummy three-dimensional acoustic pressure data set where a submarine is moving, we demonstrate that the submarineâ€™s trajectory can be tracked using Fourier transform to extract the submarine frequency signature, implementing a filter that extracts this frequency signature to denoise the data, and detecting the submarine over time. In this data set, central frequencies are (-4.712, -1.885, 7.226) and (4.712, 1.885, -7.226), and the filter used is Gaussian. This method has a wide range of applicability in biological oceanography and fisheries research to track marine animal movement.
