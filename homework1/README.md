## Abstract

The three-dimensional underwater movements of an object that vibrates with a frequency signature can be tracked using acoustic pressure measurements. Vibrations result in mechanical disturbances that propagate through the fluid, increasing or decreasing pressure with time. Acoustic pressure data can be noisy. Using a noisy three-dimensional acoustic pressure data set where a submarine is moving, we demonstrate that the submarine's trajectory can be tracked using Fourier transform to extract the submarine frequency signature, implementing a filter that extracts this frequency signature to denoise the data, and detecting the submarine over time. This method has a wide range of applicability in biological oceanography and fisheries research to track marine animal movement.
